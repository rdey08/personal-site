// schema.org WebSite for the home page. This is what Google reads to choose
// the site name printed above the URL in a search result
// (developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names). Without it the
// bare domain is the fallback, which is why results read "rupakdey.com"
// rather than "Rupak Dey".
//
// Three constraints worth knowing before moving this file:
//   - it only counts on the home page of a root domain, not on subpages;
//   - <title> and og:site_name are secondary signals that should agree with
//     it, and here all three resolve from SITE_NAME so they cannot drift;
//   - it is a hint, not a directive. Google may still show something else.
//
// Separate from PersonJsonLd because they are different entities: the Person
// is who the site is about, the WebSite is the publication itself.
